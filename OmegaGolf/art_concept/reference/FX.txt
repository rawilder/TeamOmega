Special Effects

EFFECT LIST::

	Ball Trail (snow/sand trails)
		- Using Unity Particle System
		- Limited Time / Number of particles allowed
		- If we decide to go with permanent trails we will have to implement decal shader where we
			draw the trails on a 2d texture
		
	Object Glow
		- Using Unity Particle System
		- Possible to write shader for it instead, however more difficult
		- Desires:
			Smooth outline
			Pulsing
			not overwhelming
		
	Water Drop , Steam/Smoke, Dirt Kickup
		- Using Unity Particle System
		
	Clouds
		- 2d Texture

	Trees
		- Unity tree creator doesn't do low poly trees well
		- Suggestion : model trees in maya and make swaying in wind animation
		
	Grass
		- Unity foliage can only be applied to terrain objects, we won't be using terrains
		- Suggestion : 2D grass texture
	
	Water
